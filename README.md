# Nabu

Nabu is a collection of tools for Typescript applications.

## Disclaimer

I've written Nabu to factorize some code I tend to re-use in many different projects.
Its still a work in progress, and interfaces might change in the future.

## Usage

Add ./nabu.js to your project

Use ./nabu.d.ts for your Typescript project.

## Documentation
